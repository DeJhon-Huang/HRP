Hybrid reflection probes for Unity.

The relfection probe stores albedo, normals and depth texture which is rendered offline in the editor.
During runtime the reflection probe is able to respond to dynamic lights in the scene
as any regular 3d model would. This approach is fairly cheap, can run on a mobile device
and is able to emulate somewhat realtime reflections with global illumination for free.
